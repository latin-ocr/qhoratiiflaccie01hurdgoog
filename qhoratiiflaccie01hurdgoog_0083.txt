service or ornament of society in manual
exercises and operatione is found to· haren
place inhio writings. Rural affairs, in
their several branches; the mechanic, ancl
all the polite acts of sculpture, pointing,
and architectum are occasionally hinted ert
in his poems; or, rather, their various ,
imagery, so far as they were known and
proctised in those times, is fully aod largcly
displayed. Now this, though it show the
prodigious extent of his observation and
diligent curiosry, which could search
through all the storehouses and magarines
‘of ort, fot· materials of description, yet is
not to be placed to the score of his superior
inventive faculty3 nor infers any thing to
the disadvantage os succecding poeto, whose
subjecto might obligo rhem to the same dc·
scriptions3 any more than his vast ae·
quaintance with natural fienery, in all ire
numberlesr appearancen implies a want of
genius in later imitators, who, if they ven·
rnred, at all, into this province, were con·'
{hrained cogive us the same unveried rr·
prrssrrtatiorrs.
