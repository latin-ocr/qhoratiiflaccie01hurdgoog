‘⁵ Rolcompron was often pleased with this

Μι. Dryden What think you then of
tilis obseruation ιιι one of Pliny's Lettere,

“Ut quasdam artes, ita eloquentiam nihil
f‘ magis qualtn ancipitia commendant. Vides
“nui fune in summa nituntur, quantos¹
‘¹‘ soleant excitare · elamoreS, clun jam jani<

tor. The verses are of Barnea:

He perse& Dancer eltmbs the Rope , -
And balanees your fear and hope: Η
after some distmgurlhd leap‚ , ,
He drops lus Pole and eerns to llrp ’ ⁴ ¹
